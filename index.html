											<h3>Read what other people say:</h3>
											<p>"Prasanthi is a great coach and really takes an interest in your project. 
											The strategies she uses to identify the areas where you are stuck and working 
											through them are really worthwhile and allowed me to identify and optimise my 
											next steps. Highly recommended! Thanks Prasanthi!" - Shweta K </p>
											<p>"Prasanthi is a brilliant coach; she gives you the freedom and space to talk
											and discover the answers to your own questions. During our sessions, I managed
											to complete my goals which at the beginning of the sessions, felt like an 
											impossibility. Highly recommended." - Andrew M </p>
											<p>"I speak from experience when I say that Prasanthi is a brilliant coach. 
											She was extremely commited to helping me achieve the goals I wanted. She was able 
											to encourage me to finding the answers myself, and at the same time was able to 
											guide me confidently during that process. 
											100% I would recommend Prasanthi to anyone considering coaching." - Paresh H </p>
											<p>"Prasanthi provides the space for one to reach their own conclusions , which is
											imperative for long term change. She is an empathic listener and encourages one to 
											achieve their potential, facilitating removal of obstacles easily. Having known 
											Prasanthi for a number of years, I am aware of her compassionate nature and her belief 
											in the uniqueness of each person. As such, her clients can only benefit." - Alka D </p>
											<p> "I found my coaching sessions with Prasanthi very positive and enjoyable. She 
											helped to keep me focused on what I wanted to achieve in each session and ultimately
											on my end goal... She recognised that I can over commit, which then leads to doing a 
											lot less and feeling faliure so she constantly challenged my commitment... I now have
											my action plan written down and I regularly refer back to it to check in how I am
											progressing ans succeeding... Thank you for your help, patience and laughter." - Mariam V</p>
											<p>"Coaching helped me to understand my situation, get clarification about what I want
											to do, the things that are important to me, and what really matters... Prasanthi Matharu is
											a very skilled coach who has helped me achieve my goals." - Tirath S</p>
